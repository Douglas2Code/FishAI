# FishAI

This repo contains a jupyter notebook with python code for individual fish ID modeling via CNN.

The dataset contains 6 images from each of 27 individual brook trout (162 images). Annotations include 2 labels: "IndID" = individual ID code (n=27) and "PopID" = source population code (n=3).

Photos and annotation files can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ye5yLqB9zVCRKy5svQOiX0Zs1FJQjDqh?usp=sharing

Original code was developed by Mona Arami and Natalya Rapstine. Than Hitt provided edits.
